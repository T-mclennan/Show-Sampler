## ShowTaster App:

#### Currently under construction - still doing design and mockups! 

### Auto-generate a spotify playlist out of upcoming music acts in chosen city.

  - This application takes a city name and dates from the user, and generates a spotify playlist based on genre filters.
  - Lazy registration will be used prompting the user to log in to spotify before request is processed.
  - Ticketmaster API is used to retrieve list of artists playing at the location time. 
  - Spotify is then used to generate a new playlist and add in one track from each artist that meets criteria. 
  - Guest usage could be possible with generic spotify credientials, but strict testing would have to be done to ensure playlist gets deleted on unmount.
  - Interface could display show information of currently playing track, link to purchase show in ticketmaster. 
  - I'd love to limit necessary interaction to 1 or 2 clicks before music is playing.
